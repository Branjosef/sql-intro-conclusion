# Getting Started with SQL Conclusion

We've learned all about the basics of SQL. With SQL, we can store and find
stored data. SQL has many variations, but specifically covered using SQLite.

Over the past several lessons, we covered how to create and open a database file
and table, the three specific SQLite database types, how to create advanced
queries using aggregator functions, and relational database mapping in
object-oriented programming--including connecting to a database, creating tables
and finding/saving data.

This gives us the foundational tools of understanding how to build and
manipulate databases. This will tie into future concepts, as we cover databases
and Ruby more in-depth.
