# Getting Started with SQL Conclusion

We've learned all about the basics of SQL. With SQL, we can store and find our
stored data. SQL has many variations. So far, we've looked specifically at
SQLite and will continue to use it for our database needs throughout this
course.

Over the past several lessons we covered:

* How to create and open a database file and table
* The three specific SQLite database types
* How to create advanced queries using aggregator functions
* Relational database mapping in object-oriented programming--including
  connecting to a database, creating tables and finding/saving data.

This gives us the foundational tools of understanding how to build and
manipulate databases. This will tie into future concepts, as we cover databases
and Ruby more in-depth.
